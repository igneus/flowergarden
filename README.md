This is my Django-learning project.
It is a webization of one of the man's most important tasks:
to give girls and women flowers.

# flowergarden #

*flowergarden* is the true environmental revolution:
no more flowers need to die because of human love.
Give beautiful electronical flowers instead of the poor real ones!
Save the flowers, save the world!
Every girl who likes receiving flowers should have an account at *flowergarden*.
